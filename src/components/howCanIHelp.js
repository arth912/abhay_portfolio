                                <p>Whether I’m outlining marketing plans or analyzing ways to
                                    communicate an organization’s message, I love using social media
                                    to connect with a brand’s audience. It’s faster, cheaper, and
                                    more effective than traditional advertising. And unlike press
                                    releases, you control the story.</p>

                                    much. Stick with Facebook and e-mail. Trying to draw young teens
                                    to your latest line of jeans? Meet them where they are, and
                                    consider advertising through influencers on YouTube and other
                                    platforms.</p>

                                    your brand. And it’s what sets you apart. In competitive

                                <p>Like the website? I made it myself. Seriously, though, I’ve coded
                                    this website using HTML5 and CSS for one of my senior projects.
                                    I love customizing it, tweaking settings, adjusting blocks, and
                                    shaping the code to my vision. From the color schemes to the
                                    layout of images and text, I’ve crafted a digital resume that is
                                    like me: just a little different.</p>
                                <p>After I turned the project in, I remade the site, designing it in
                                    WordPress. It&#8217;s now faster, more responsive, and easy to
                                    work with. Since then I&#8217;ve worked as a freelancer, making
                                    websites for small businesses.</p>
                                <p>Does your website still look like it was built in 2005? The

                                    design even easier, including industry titans like WordPress and
                                    Squarespace. I’ve used both, and I’m well-prepared to help bring

                                    blind. Are you reaching your audience effectively? Who’s seeing
                                    your material? What content is most likely to go viral? Research

                                    metrics to develop marketing strategy. Simply put, if you
                                    aren&#8217;t using analytics to determine your social media
                                    success, you&#8217;re probably wasting your time. Never post
                                    just to post.</p>
                                <p>Create a concrete, research-based strategy and stick to it,
                                    ensuring that all posts work within that strategy. And then use
                                    numbers, competitor research, internal analysis, and industry
                                    trends to determine your ROI.</p>

                                industry: media relations. By building relationships with the local
